# OpenSCAD-Arm
OpenSCAD files for Robot Arm

If you want to modify the Arm design, for example changing the arm lengths, you can do this with the OpenSCAD code. 
All of the dimensions of the arm can be modified and in addition, the code can perform a range of motion simulation which calculates the motor torques at each
position, which can be used for sizing the motors.
